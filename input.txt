From the American Yawp:
Decades of financial deregulation had rolled back
Depression-era restraints and again allowed risky
business practices to dominate the world of American
finance. It was a bipartisan agenda. In the 1990s,
for instance, Bill Clinton signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act, repealing provisions of the 1933 Glass-Steagall
Act separating commercial and investment banks, and
the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which exempted
credit-default swaps-perhaps the key financial mechanism
behind the crash-from regulation.
